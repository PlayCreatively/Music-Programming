1. Define your area of interest and the problem space
	- Write a short outline of your chosen area of interest.
	- Explain what problem(s) your project aims to solve and why this matters.

# Interest and Problem Space
Initially my interest was in creating a novel playground for non-musically-inclined people for them to play around with and explore the sound spectrum in visually playful and intuitive space. This consisted of a freely composable node system where inputs and outputs could be visualized and creatively combined. As that isn't quite novel yet, I wanted to explore unconventional input systems and to be able to comprehensively explore that, I wanted the user to be able to create that themselves and therefore needed to create a lightweight but powerful engine that allows you to create arbitrary values and connect them in any way you wish. 

| This would be achievable with ECS as it's highly intuitive with its declarative programming which also allows me to offload the needed scaffolding to the engine through ECS's systems. This would allow you to create your own unique interface, make physics driven audio generation and generally create whatever quirky thing you want.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ![[Group 9.png\|300]]<br>![[Pasted image 20251104203841.png\|300]]           |

| One of the first interfaces I thought of was a 2D pad (not knowing it was a thing) to easily change two parameters with your mouse and quickly explore an exhaustive space, and just like with a slider, you leave it in any state you like, allowing you play with multiple pads.<br>This made me reflect on the fact that a 2D pad is just a two dimensional slider. So what if sliders were curvy? What if they're defined by a function? I've seen it in Desmos and I thought it would make a versatile Swiss-knife node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ![[Pasted image 20251104210827.png]]                                         |

| Then I thought 2D was a very limiting space as it only allows you to explore the space of 2 variables. What if I could project 3D space or higher into 2D space?<br>GPT told me about [space-filling curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve) which I remember seeing it featured in a [3-blue-1-brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7h2MHQtxc) a long time ago. This allows me to linearly slither trough any dimensional space and map it down to 1D. To turn that into a 2D pad I would just slither through the 2D space and therefore I have an (n)-D to 1D to 2D mapping. The biggest caveat is that although the way it slithers through space is comprehensive (assuming sufficiently high resolution, of course), it can't keep perfect locality. As you can see, even the Hilbert Curve which is comparatively good at upholding locality still contains drastic jump at sections. And if that's the case with 2D, it will only become more extreme in higher dimensions. | ![[Pasted image 20251104212521.png]]<br>![[hilbert curve colored.png]] |

2. Undertake initial research into existing solutions
	- Find at least three existing solutions in the same general problem space.
	- Ask: How have others tackled similar issues?
	- Collect citations, URLs, and brief notes for your report.
	- Summarise your findings in Obsidian or another note-taking tool.

3. Establish requirements
	- Sketch out the requirements of your solution using personas or Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) frameworks.
	- Consider the interaction design principles we discussed today
