[Child friendly](user) and playful Visual Audio Generator
## Goals üèÜ
* Get kids interested in creative audio generation.
* Be an intuitive and playful interface that lowers the entry point into audio computing and builds intuition that's later transferable to more complicated tools. 
* Marketing: to attract a userbase, leaning into meme-ability and silly visuals/audio is important, but not a requirement. Here's an [example](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059990/Trombone_Champ/).  
## Definition
Software that allows the [[user]] to intuitively wire [[quirky interfaces]] to various digital audio generators. These interfaces will be made up of intuitive and friendly looking gizmos (which maybe later on, will be controllable through midi/external hardware) as well as simulated physically driven interfaces.
